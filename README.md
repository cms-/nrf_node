#nrf_node
A nRF24L01-based firmware to handle data collection, transmission, and basic self-diagnostics. 

Communicates with a series of other nodes and one nrf_bridge in a star configuration. Node collects and transmits data from the field. Bridge acts as a relay between remote nodes and an IP-enabled processing device. Based on a STM32030F4 microcontroller. Hardware schematic to follow.
